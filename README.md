=======


Image classification is a amazing deep learning project that I've worked on. 

- In this project, We build a convolution neural network on a CIFAR-10 dataset. 

- To begin with, we did some exploration in our dataset, and then trained our deep neural network using python and keras.

- Finally we built a GUI in which images can be uploaded to and can be used for prediction.


### Important Dependencies

**tkinter** is required for GUI creation and launching the application -
`!conda install -c anaconda tk`

## About the Dataset

CIFAR-10 is a very popular computer vision dataset. This dataset is well studied in many types of deep learning research for object recognition.

This dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 10 target classes, with each category containing 6000 images of shape 32*32. This dataset contains images of low resolution (32*32), which allows researchers to try new algorithms. The 10 different classes of this dataset are:

 * Airplane
 * Car
 * Bird
 * Cat
 * Deer
 * Dog
 * Frog
 * Horse
 * Ship
 * Truck

CIFAR-10 dataset is already available in the datasets module of Keras. We do not need to download it; we can directly import it from keras.datasets.

## Starting Project

* The pretrained model must be loaded in GUI CIFAR10 Dataset.py for its working.
  *  `model_2o3.h5`
  

* run `main_run.py` in a python environment with `model_2o3.h5` and all the dependencies setup. 
  

That's all folks! We're good to go!
